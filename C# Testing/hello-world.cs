// In the code above, the using System; statement is used to import the System namespace, which provides access to the Console class used to output the "Hello World" string.

// The namespace HelloWorld block defines a namespace, which is used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts. Inside the namespace, the class Program block defines a Program class, which contains the Main method. The Main method is the entry point of the program, and it contains a call to the Console.WriteLine method, which outputs the "Hello World" string to the console.
