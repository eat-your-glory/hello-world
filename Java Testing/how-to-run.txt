Compile it using the javac compiler. For example:

"javac HelloWorld.java"

(without the quotation marks)

This will create a HelloWorld.class file that contains the compiled Java bytecode. You can run this file using the java command to see the "Hello World" message. For example:

"java HelloWorld"

(without the quotation marks)
