</html>

<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> line at the top of the code is called the document type declaration and is used to tell the web browser that the page is written using the HTML5 language.

The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page, and all other elements on the page should be nested inside this element.

The <head> element is used to provide information about the page, such as the title, which is specified in the <title> element.

The <body> element contains the content that is visible on the webpage. In this case, the <h1> element is used to create a "Hello World" heading. -->
